        <h4>About Me</h4>
        
        <p class="box1">I am a 22 year old student <span class="bold">student</span> at BYU and I am from Beautiful California</p>

        <p class="box1">One of the things I enjoy in life the most is weightlifting, I try to go to the gym every day. Additionally I am training for an Ironman in April. I like to combine my endurance training with my strenght training as well. I train 12 times a week between the two and I truly enjoy listening to podcasts and reading about all things fitness.</p>

        <p class="box1">Below I included a video of the Ironman world championships in 2022. I also love about my family, I included a picture of my siblings below.</p>
